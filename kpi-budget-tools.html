            <h3>2. Mini Budget Plan</h3>
            <p>This month's budget was prepared with the goal of maximizing team optimization and
                personal satisfaction. Using a tool like Slack Premium enabled more pleasant real-time
                communication, which directly impacted the speed and clarity of internal ticket resolution.
                Integrating Microsoft Learn Premium as a training program among staff members helped us
                meet the objectives of Continuous learning, and users gained the necessary skills in
                troubleshooting and online cloud services (John, 2024). Hardware purchases, including SSDs,
                reduced lag time and increased the system's speed, directly contributing to the speed of
                support (Tilahun, 2023)</p>

            <h3>3. Monthly Summary Report</h3>
            <p>
                The current performance for the month indicates significant improvements in the system's
                responsiveness and reliability. We achieved a First Contact Resolution rate of 79%, which is
                on track to meet our goal of 80% with coaching and enhanced Tier 1 documentation. After
                installing SSDs and implementing improved monitoring, the system's uptime increased to
                99.7%, exceeding expectations. This week, we successfully closed 175 tickets, exceeding our
                target of 160 tickets.
