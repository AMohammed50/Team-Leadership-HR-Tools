            <p>
                Over the course of <strong>15 weeks</strong>, the <em>IT Supervisor Readiness Web Portfolio</em> will be
                executed through a sequence of systematic phases:
            </p>

            <p>
                In <strong>Week 1</strong>, the project will commence with a kickoff phase involving the identification
                of key objectives, deliverables, and resource selection. <strong>Week 2</strong> will be dedicated to
                strategic planning and content structure, including wireframes for each page (Toolkit, Escalation
                Matrix, Ticket Response, and Reporting).
            </p>

            <p>
                During <strong>Week 3</strong>, the Customer Service Standards Statement will be drafted and finalized,
                followed by the development of the Escalation Matrix in <strong>Week 4</strong>. <strong>Week 5</strong>
                will focus on composing a sample Helpdesk Ticket Response document, while <strong>Week 6</strong> will
                address the design of a professional Incident Report Template.
            </p>

            <p>
                The web interface design begins in <strong>Week 7</strong> with the navigation bar layout and user
                interface flow. <strong>Week 8</strong> will include the development of the primary HTML file
                (<code>index.html</code>) showcasing the toolkit, and in <strong>Week 9</strong>, the secondary page
                (<code>project-plan.html</code>) will be built to display the timeline, KPIs, and a financial budget
                overview.
            </p>

            <p>
                Aesthetic consistency and responsiveness will be addressed in <strong>Week 10</strong> via custom CSS
                design (<code>style.css</code>). <strong>Week 11</strong> will be used for functional validationâ€”testing
                download links, media responsiveness, and overall user experience across browsers and devices.
            </p>

            <p>
                In <strong>Week 12</strong>, all assets including PDFs, DOCX files, and supporting graphics will be
                compiled. <strong>Week 13</strong> will be designated for peer or instructor review, ensuring the
                content meets quality benchmarks. Following that, <strong>Week 14</strong> will involve comprehensive
                refinements based on the feedback received.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, <strong>Week 15</strong> culminates in the formal submission and/or deployment of the full
                portfolio, ensuring compliance with technical expectations and presentation standards.
